# Spinnaker All-In-One (Minnaker) Quick Start

**Previously known as Mini-Spinnaker**

Minnaker is currently intended for POCs and trying out Spinnaker.

## Background

Minnaker performs the following actions when run on a single Linux instance:

* Installs [k3s](http://rancher.com) with Traefik turned off.
* Installs minio in k3s with a local volume.
* Sets up **Halyard** in a Docker container (running in Kubernetes).
* Installs **Spinnaker** using Halyard.
* Minnaker uses local authentication. The username is `admin` and the password is randomly generated when you install Minnaker. Find more details about getting the password in [Accessing Spinnaker](#accessing-spinnaker).
* [Optionally] Configures development environment.

## Requirements

To use Minnaker, make sure your Linux instance meets the following requirements:

* Ubuntu 18.04 or Debian 10 (VM or bare metal)
* 2 vCPUs (recommend 4)
* 8Gb of RAM (recommend 16)
* 30GB of HDD (recommend 40+)
* NAT or Bridged networking with access to the internet
* `curl` and `git` are available. For example, to install `curl` and `git` on Debian, run the following command:
  
    ```
    sudo apt-get install curl git
    ```

* Port `443` on your VM needs to be accessible from your workstation / browser. By default, Minnaker installs Spinnaker and configures it to listen on port `443`, using paths `/` and `/api/v1`(for the UI and API).


## Changelog 

* As of 11/11/2019, Minnaker uses port 443 (instead of 80) and Traefik's default self-signed certificate.
* If you installed Minnaker prior to November 2019, you can switch to the new path mechanism using [Switch to Paths](switch_to_paths.md).
* As of 10/18/2019, Minnaker no longer uses port 8084.

## Installation

1. Login (SSH) to your VM or bare metal box.
2. Clone the minnaker repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/armory/minnaker
    ```

3. Change the working directory to _minnaker/scripts_:

    ```bash
    cd minnaker/scripts
    ```

4. Make the install script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod 775 all.sh
    ```

5. Execute the install script. Note the following options before running the script:
     * Add the `-o` flag if you want to install open source Spinnaker.
     * By default, the script installs Armory Spinnaker and uses your public IP address (determined by `curl`ing `ifconfig.co`) as the endpoint for Spinnaker.
     * For bare metal or a local VM, specify the IP address for your server with the `-p` and `-P` flags. `-p` is the 'Private IP' and must be an IP address that exists on an interface on the machine. `-P` is the 'Public IP' and must be an address or DNS name you will use to access Spinnaker.

    ```bash
    ./all.sh
    ```

    For example, the following command installs OSS Spinnaker on a VM with the IP address of `192.168.10.1`:

    ```bash
    export PRIVATE_IP=192.168.10.1
    export PUBLIC_IP=54.252.234.226
    ./all.sh -o -P $PUBLIC_IP -p $PRIVATE_IP
    ```

    Installation can take between 5-10 minutes to complete depending on VM size.

## Accessing Spinnaker

1. Determine your IP_ADDR. On the Linux host, run the following command:

    ```bash
    hostname -I
    ```

    Alternately, run this command:

    ```bash
    grep override /etc/spinnaker/.hal/config
    ```

    Use the first URL.

2. Get the Spinnaker password. On the Linux host, run the following command:

    ```bash
    cat /etc/spinnaker/.hal/.secret/spinnaker_password
    ```

3. In your browser, navigate to the IP_ADDR (https://IP/) for Spinnaker from step 1. This is Deck, the Spinnaker UI.
     
     If you installed Minnaker on a local VM, you must access it from your local machine. If you deployed Minnaker in the cloud, such as an EC2 instance, you can access Spinnaker from any machine that has access to that 'Public IP'.

4. Log in to Deck with the following credentials:
   
    Username: `admin`

    Password: <Password from step 2>   

## Changing Your Spinnaker Configuration

1. SSH into the machine where you have installed Spinnaker
2. Access the Halyard pod:

    ```bash
    export HAL_POD=$(kubectl -n spinnaker get pod -l app=halyard -oname | cut -d'/' -f 2)

    kubectl -n spinnaker exec -it ${HAL_POD} bash
    ```

3. Run Halyard configuration commands. For example, the following command allows you to configure and view the current deployment of Spinnakerâ€™s version.

    ```bash
    hal config version
    ```
    All Halyard configuration files are stored in `/etc/spinnaker/.hal`

    For more information about Armory's Halyard, see [Armory Halyard commands](https://docs.armory.io/spinnaker/armory_halyard/).

    For more information about open source Halyard, see [Halyard commands](https://www.spinnaker.io/reference/halyard/commands/).    
  
4. When finished, use the `exit` command to leave the pod.


## Details

* If you shut down and restart the instance and it gets different IP addresses, you'll have to update Spinnaker with the new IP address(es):

  * If the public IP address has changed:
    * Update `/etc/spinnaker/.hal/public_ip` with the new public IP address
    * Update `/etc/spinnaker/.hal/config` Update with the new public IP addresses (Look for `overrideBaseUrl` fields) (if you haven't switch to DNS)
    * `/etc/spinnaker/.hal/config-seed` Update with the new public IP addresses (Look for `overrideBaseUrl` fields) (if you haven't switch to DNS)
  * If the private IP address has changed:
    * Update `/etc/spinnaker/.hal/private_ip` with the new private IP address
    * Update the kubeconfigs at `/etc/spinnaker/.kube/config` and `/etc/spinnaker/.hal/.secret/kubeconfig-spinnaker-sa` with the new private IP address (in the `.clusters.cluster.server` field)
  * After you update the IP address, run `hal deploy apply`

* Certificate support isn't yet documented.  There are several ways to achieve this:
  * Using actual cert files: create certs that Traefik can use in the ingress definition(s)
  * Using ACM or equivalent: put a certificate in front of the instance and change the overrides
  * Either way, you *must* use certificates that your browser will trust that match your DNS name (your browser may not prompt to trust the untrusted API certificate)

* If you need to get the password again, you can see the generated password in `/etc/spinnaker/.hal/.secret/spinnaker_password`:

  ```bash
  cat /etc/spinnaker/.hal/.secret/spinnaker_password
  ```
